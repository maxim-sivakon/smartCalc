@strong{The SmartCalc v1.0 program help you with:}@*

- Calculating arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation@*
- Calculating arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation with substitution of the value of the variable x as a number@*
- Plotting a graph of a function given by an expression in infix notation with the variable x@*
- Calculating credits and deposits@*


@node Calculation of bracketed arithmetic expressions
@chapter Calculation of bracketed arithmetic expressions

@strong{The SmartCalc v1.0 program supports:}@*

Calculation of bracketed arithmetic expressions with operations:@*
1) addition (+)@*
2) subtraction(-)@*
3) multiplication(*)@*
4) division(/)@*
5) power(^)@*
6) modulus(%)@*
7) unary plus(+)@*
8) unary minus(-)@*

and functions:@*
1) Computes cosine cos(x)@*
2) Computes sine sin(x)@*
3) Computes tangent tan(x)@*
4) Computes arc cosine acos(x)@*
5) Computes arc sine asin(x)@*
6) Computes arc tangent atan(x)@*
7) Computes square root sqrt(x)@*
8)Computes natural logarithm ln(x)@*
9)Computes common logarithm log(x)@*


@node Graphs
@chapter Graphs

Program is plotting a graph of a function given by an expression in infix notation with the variable x (with coordinate axes, mark of the used scale and an adaptive grid)@*
You just need to input the expression with x and limits for x and y variables@*
After you input expression and limits on the main page you can change values on the graph page


@node Credit calculator
@chapter Credit calculator

You just need to input:@*
1) total credit amount@*
2) term@*
3) interest rate@*
4) type (annuity, differentiated)@*

And you will have the result output: monthly payment, overpayment on credit, total payment


@node Deposit calculator
@chapter Deposit calculator

You just need to input:@*
1) deposit amount@*
2) deposit term@*
3) interest rate@*
4) tax rate@*
5) periodicity of payments@*
6) capitalization of interest@*
7) replenishments and partial withdrawals list@*
7) start date@*

And you will have the result output: accrued interest, tax amount, deposit amount by the end of the term
